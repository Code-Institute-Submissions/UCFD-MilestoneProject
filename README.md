# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

### The aim of this website is to introduce a popular Japanese pop rock duo Garnidelia to Western audiences.
### The site will include the following features:

- Landing page
- About page: includes the brief profile and biography of the duo
- Discography page: contains a shortlist of the duo's discography which also serves as a internal link to a
corresponding music video (embedded) if available.
- News page: provides users with the duo's latest news such as live event and new album releases.

Bootstrap will be used as a starting point for CSS styling but adjustments will be made in order to achieve
a more appealing result.
