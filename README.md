## The site will include the following features:

- Discography page: contains a shortlist of the duo's discography which also serves as a internal link to a
corresponding music video (embedded) if available.
- News page: provides users with the duo's latest news such as live event and new album releases.
- A contact form where visitors can use to send feedbacks of the website or contact host of the website directly on more specific issues.
