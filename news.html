                                            GARNiDELiA’s new single Error saw the light back on January 31, but it is now when we can finally watch the music video on YouTube for the title-track Error. The song is currently being used as the opening theme for the anime television series Beatless.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the music video, we can see the duo dressed in futuristic silver outfits. Vocalist MARiA dancing to an energetic choreography along backup dancers, while producer toku plays two synthesizers in a separated room. As for the sound, the song has strong electronic beats that submerge you in a dark atmosphere. As toku described it on the music show J-MELO:
                                            <blockquote>
                                                It’s a hybrid of strings and harp over EDM.
                                            </blockquote>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “Beatless” was originally a novel written in 2012 by Satoshi Hase and illustrated by redjuice from supercell. The anime adaptation started airing this year on January 13 with GARNiDELiA’s newest single Error as the opening. The ending theme, Primalove, is performed by the duo ClariS which will be their 28th single once it is out on February 28.

                                            GARNiDELiA has uploaded a new music video for their eight single Désir and can now be watched in most territories all around the world! The duo had previously released a music video for the title-track which was unfortunately blocked outside Japan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We have been gifted with a beautiful music video that perfectly fits this emotional ballad. Désir—French for desire—tells the story of a human girl enamored of a creature similar to a faun. The mythological being, who also likes to see her in the woods—for the obvious reasons— is not of the likes of the people as they attempt to separate him from the young lady.
                                        </p>

                                            The single went out on sale on October 23, you can purchase it in physical edition, available in three different versions, or digital edition on iTunes.

It seems that their visit to China made them realize their popularity over there as it was announced an Asian tour titled GARNiDELiA stellacage Asia Tour 2017. For now, they have only scheduled a show at Zepp Tokyo on October 1 and a second one in Taiwan on the October 14. Further information will be revealed at a later date.

                            <p>
                                GARNiDELiA’s new single Error saw the light back on January 31, but it is now when we can finally watch the music video on YouTube for the title-track Error. The song is currently being used as the opening theme for the anime television series Beatless.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the music video, we can see the duo dressed in futuristic silver outfits. Vocalist MARiA dancing to an energetic choreography along backup dancers, while producer toku plays two synthesizers in a separated room. As for the sound, the song has strong electronic beats that submerge you in a dark atmosphere. As toku described it on the music show J-MELO:
                                <blockquote>
                                    It’s a hybrid of strings and harp over EDM.
                                </blockquote>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Beatless” was originally a novel written in 2012 by Satoshi Hase and illustrated by redjuice from supercell. The anime adaptation started airing this year on January 13 with GARNiDELiA’s newest single Error as the opening. The ending theme, Primalove, is performed by the duo ClariS which will be their 28th single once it is out on February 28.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                GARNiDELiA has uploaded a new music video for their eight single Désir and can now be watched in most territories all around the world! The duo had previously released a music video for the title-track which was unfortunately blocked outside Japan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have been gifted with a beautiful music video that perfectly fits this emotional ballad. Désir—French for desire—tells the story of a human girl enamored of a creature similar to a faun. The mythological being, who also likes to see her in the woods—for the obvious reasons— is not of the likes of the people as they attempt to separate him from the young lady.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The single went out on sale on October 23, you can purchase it in physical edition, available in three different versions, or digital edition on iTunes.

                                Aikotoba is a pop dance tune that will surely stick in your head with the first listen. Some of you might have heard the song already since it is being used as the opening theme for the anime series Animegataris, which premiered on October 8.
