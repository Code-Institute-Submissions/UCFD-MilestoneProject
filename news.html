                                            GARNiDELiA’s new single Error saw the light back on January 31, but it is now when we can finally watch the music video on YouTube for the title-track Error. The song is currently being used as the opening theme for the anime television series Beatless.

                                            In the music video, we can see the duo dressed in futuristic silver outfits. Vocalist MARiA dancing to an energetic choreography along backup dancers, while producer toku plays two synthesizers in a separated room. As for the sound, the song has strong electronic beats that submerge you in a dark atmosphere. As toku described it on the music show J-MELO:
                                            <blockquote>
                                                It’s a hybrid of strings and harp over EDM.
                                            </blockquote>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “Beatless” was originally a novel written in 2012 by Satoshi Hase and illustrated by redjuice from supercell. The anime adaptation started airing this year on January 13 with GARNiDELiA’s newest single Error as the opening. The ending theme, Primalove, is performed by the duo ClariS which will be their 28th single once it is out on February 28.
